The declaration of Terranullian independence
***

In the age of reason, we the people cannot withstand to deny the powers that be. Tyrannical forces, employed by our government, imposed on the people through strategic, psychological oppression, must cease to exist. The proximity of our fate has causes us to reexamine the truths that we hold to be self-evident. All men are created by nature and are curiously and wonderfully made. Therefore, our unalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness are to be valued by all of whom that desire such qualities and secured by governmental entities, instituted by the people, monitored by the people, and most importantly, for the best interests of the people. However, our government has forsaken its oath; hence, the trust once established and respected for our leaders has been demolished as deception pollutes the once, free air of our homeland. Therefore, the time has come for us to reclaim our freedom. No more shall we suffer and be passive as our government attempts to subjugate our civil liberties; our tolerance has grown cold. To authenticate our speech, facts will bear witness to our assertion.

The government has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people.

The government has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation.

The government has embraced oligarchy, although the Law of the Land forbids it, and which also imposes on our personal, political, and economic freedoms.

The government has failed to disclose information on acts of terrorism, both home and abroad, although truth is a fundamental belief that should be shared and practiced by all Terranullians.

The government has engaged in preemptive war without the civilian control of the military.

The government has used false flag terrorism and staged provocations in an effort to justify their malicious objectives for global control.

The government has in many cases, verboten our right to petition and peacefully assemble for a redress of grievances, which by doing so violates our constitution.

The government has denied the presence of political diversity and has ruled our country by a dual-party system.

Throughout the course of these Oppressions, many of us were ignorant to the fact that our leaders were engaged in such atrocities. Some of us feared knowing the truth; and instead, negated the facts as a defense mechanism to mask our disappointment. Amongst the few, however, the truth was transparent, as we wrestled against the pressures of conformity. Yet, we persevered and we will no longer allow our government to be deaf to the voice of justice nor dilatory in amending the current state of our nation.

We, therefore, the people of the Terranullius, declare our sovereignty. We are the ultimate authority of our government and our nation. We expect and demand that the our government will belay from secrecy and cloth itself in truth and integrity. We reject the status quo and are united in our pursuit to bring into fruition the constitutional and foundational precepts of our great nation.

PREAMBLE

We the People of our Terranullius, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Terranullius of sovereign persons.

We the people who ordain and establish this Constitution intend the rights protected by this Constitution to be the rights of natural persons.

Articles regarding our republic including this constitution will be issued at request and a dutiful amount of time shall be given for review in the event of a request for a manuscript of rights and laws related to an offense before legal proceedings in the prosecution of a case.

The rights protected by the Constitution of the Terranullius are the rights of natural persons and do not extend to for-profit corporations, limited liability companies, or other private entities established for business purposes or to promote business interests under the laws of any state, the Terranullius, or any foreign state. People, person, or persons as used in this Constitution does not include corporations, limited liability companies or other corporate entities established by the laws of any state, the Free country Terranullius, or any foreign state, and such corporate entities are subject to such regulation as the people, through their elected state and federal representatives, deem reasonable and are otherwise consistent with the powers of Congress and the States under this Constitution. 

By the authority of the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes that governments are instituted to secure the rights of people and derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and of the Constitution.

Therefore, as all power of governance is inherent in the people, we the people of Terranullius declare that all [people] when they form a social compact are equal in right: that all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness; and they have at all times a right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper.

ARTICLE V

We the people of Terranullius declare:

We the people recognize that our communities are under siege from the corporations that cause economic, cultural, environmental, and public harm;

We the people recognize our confinement in a system of laws that grants greater rights to corporations than to residents of our communities;

We the people recognize that this system grants corporate minorities the legal authority to override the community majority right to choose that which secures its health, safety, and welfare;

We the people recognize that the legal system has conferred unequal power on the basis of property ownership so that those holding the most property obtain and wield superior rights;

We the people recognize that this system of law hinders and obstructs our ability to adapt to economic, cultural, and environmental change;

We the people recognize that corporate control of legislation and governance denies our right to an authentically democratic local, state, and federal representation necessary to protect our communities from corporate harms;

We the people recognize that our health, safety, welfare, and survival of our local businesses, farms, ecosystems, and neighborhoods depend on restructuring the current system of governance, because it favors corporations over community-based, democratic decision-making;

We the people recognize that, because a republic means “governance of, by, and for the people” and “consent of the governed”, a republic shall exist in our communities, states, or within the Terranullius ;

Therefore, we now exercise our inherent and inalienable right to create an authentic republic in our   communities, municipalities, and counties within our State; and We the People call on communities across the states of Terranullius to:

Maximal propositions on taxation

Income tax brackets in assumption of legislation/amendment passing whose text describes a levy that shall lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived and with regard to the census/enumeration. These taxes are not to compound after their initial dues are paid, such as transference from a person to another family member/spouse; Only in the case of a buisness where enumeration is transfered through employment of an individual does any measure of compounding seem un-avoidable.
